Peserta memahami rangkaian proses analitik data menggunakan pendekatan pembelajaran mesin.\n","2.   Peserta memahami bahwa proses pengembangan model pembelajaran mesin juga ditentukan dari kualitas data, penanganan data, dan penentuan algoritma serta hyperparameter-nya; tidak cukup hanya dengan memastikan implementasi algoritma berjalan tanpa kesalahan.\n","3.   Peserta mampu menginterpretasikan hasil dari evaluasi model dalam proses analitik menggunakan pendekatan pembelajaran mesin.\n","\n","Praktikum dilaksanakan secara berkelompok. Setiap kelompok terdiri atas 2 mahasiswa. Perhatikan bahwa terdapat berkas yang harus dikumpulkan saat keberjalanan praktikum untuk bagian A (25 April 2024, pukul 12.00 WIB) dan berkas yang dikumpulkan setelah waktu praktikum selesai untuk bagian B (25 April 2024, pukul 21.00 WIB)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_gqF1aWknecy"},"source":["Disediakan data yang sudah dibagi menjadi data latih (`df_train`), data validasi (`df_val`), dan data uji (`df_test`).\n","\n","**Bagian 1**: (batas waktu: 25 April 2024, 12.00 WIB)\n","\n","1.
